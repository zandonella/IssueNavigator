# Privacy Policy

Issue Navigator does not collect, sell, or transfer personal user data.

## Authentication

If you choose to authenticate with GitHub, the extension stores your GitHub OAuth token locally using Chrome storage and is never shared with third parties.

## Data Access & Storage

- Preferences (e.g., keybindings, filters) are stored via Chrome sync storage.
- Temporary caches of GitHub API responses may be stored in session storage to reduce duplicate requests and improve performance.
- The extension runs on GitHub pages to read the current URL/route so it can provide navigation. It does not collect or transmit page content or browsing history.

## Third Parties

Issue Navigator communicates only with GitHubâ€™s official API (`https://api.github.com/`). No analytics or advertising services are used.
